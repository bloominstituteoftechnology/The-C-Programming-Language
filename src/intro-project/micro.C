/*
 * Every C program that we want to compile into an executable binary needs to
 * wrap its primary functionality into a function called `main`. A compiled
 * binary, when executed, calls the `main` function. Note the `int` keyword
 * before the `main` function. That designates the type of the return value of
 * the function. Here, let's just declare a variable `x` that will store an
 * integer. Then return that integer. 
 * 
 * Compile the program with `gcc micro.c -o micro`. If that ran successfully,
 * you'll see that there will now be an executable called `micro` in your
 * directory.
 * 
 * Execute that with the command `./micro`. What happens?
